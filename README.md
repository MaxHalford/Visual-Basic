# Visual Basic Snippets and Projects

A list of code I produced during my associate's year at the TSE. At the time I wasn't very familiar programming so everything is not very polished and anyway I don't use Visual Basic anymore. To run every file simply install Microsoft Visual Studio and run ``.sln`` files.

``Projet Robot Peinture`` contains an ``Wally.exe`` file you can run without needing Microsoft Visual Studio, provided you can run .exe files.

As I said this is getting old and I don't bother explaining every project as they are quite self-explanatory when launched. However here is a list with a brief synopsis:

- ``Calculatrice`` - Scientific calculator.
- ``Diviseurs`` - Common divisors of a list of numbers.
- ``Genetique`` - Enhancing the DNA of a population with a genetic algorithm.
- ``Moyenne`` - Average of a list of numbers.
- ``Nombres Complexes`` - Functions to handle complex numbers.
- ``PGCD`` - [Greatest common divisor](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Greatest_common_divisor).
- ``Projet Metro`` - Graphically simulating metro lines.
- ``Projet Robot Peinture`` - Programming a cleaning robot with a genetic algorithm.
- ``Puissance`` - Powers of numbers.
- ``Restes Chinois`` - [Chinese remainder theorem](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chinese_remainder_theorem).
- ``Tri bulles de complexes`` - Bubble sorting a list of complex numbers.
